## What is Itylos
Itylos is a low-budget DIY home security alarm targeted mainly for the Rapsberry Pi,
but it can be deployed on any system with java and a running mongo db. Itylos target is to provide a simple
and powerful solution to securely monitor your property via door,window and movement sensors. 

Itylos is an open source home monitoring tool that is free! and :
* is able to manage sensors of any kind. Wireless or not. Consult the Rest API documentation on how to configure your sensors or
check our blog for some examples.
* monitors events received from sensors and triggers actions like sending emails, pushbullet notifications etc...
* integrates fully with kerberos.io!. Check our blog on how to connect those two systems.
* is extensible. You need to trigger a siren or open lights when alarm is triggered? Just use the webhooks and
connect your custom made siren/lights with simple steps avoiding external notification systems that require 
an active internet connection


## What itylos is not
Itylos is not a home automation system and is not a cloud service that you pay to secure your property! Even though
we have worked hard to make Itylos a complete home security/monitoring system, Itylos cannot guarantee the full security 
of your property ! Use it on your own risk. (We use it and we are really happy!)
