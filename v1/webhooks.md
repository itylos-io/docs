## Webhooks Description

Webhooks allow you to easily integrate Itylos.io with external apps.
When an event is triggered, Itylos.io will send a HTTP POST payload to the webhookâ€™s configured URLs. 

Webhooks can be used for example to:   
* trigger a custom TCP/IP siren
* trigger an external alarm system
* trigger a custom notification service
* and much more...

Itylos.io will send a HTTP POST payload when:
* alarm is triggered
* new sensor event is submitted
* alarm status gets updated

```json
{
    "eventType": "alarmTriggered"
}
```
